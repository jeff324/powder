Title: Power posterior sampling via differential evolution
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jeffrey Annis
Maintainer: Jeffrey Annis <jannis@mail.usf.edu>
Description: Samples from power posteriors via differential evolution. The samples
    are then used to estimate the marginal likelihood. Posterior estimation (power=1)
    is also available. The package includes the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model as an example, 
    but can be extended to sample from any model.
