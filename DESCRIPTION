Title: Power posterior sampling via differential evolution
Version: 0.0.9000
Author: Jeffrey Annis
Maintainer: Jeffrey Annis <jannis@mail.usf.edu>
Description: Samples from power posteriors via differential evolution. The samples
    are then used to estimate the marginal likelihood. Posterior estimation
    is also available. The package includes the Linear Ballistic Accumulator 
    and Drift Diffusion models as examples, but can be extended to sample from any model.
